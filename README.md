# Data-Science-Internship_Tasks
Internship Data science tasks - Iris Dataset, Credit Risk Prediction, Customer Churn, Insurance Claim Prediction, and Personal loan acceptance.
Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains all five tasks completed during my Data Science Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation. Each project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and includes data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

ðŸ“‚ Projects

1. Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Dataset: Iris Dataset
Skills: Data loading with Pandas, summary statistics, Matplotlib & Seaborn visualizations.


2. Credit Risk Prediction
Dataset: Loan Approval Prediction Dataset
Skills: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, Logistic Regression & Decision Tree models, accuracy & confusion matrix evaluation.


3. Customer Churn Prediction
Dataset: Churn Modelling Dataset (Bank Customers)
Skills: Categorical encoding, classification models, feature importance analysis.


4. Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Dataset
Skills: Linear Regression, impact analysis of BMI, age, and smoking on claims, MAE & RMSE evaluation.


5.Personal Loan Acceptance
Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset
Skills : Logistic Regression, Data encoding, Data exploration and visualization.

Technologies Used

     Steps Performed
     
1. Data Loading â€” Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Data Cleaning â€” Handled missing values and corrected data types.
3. Encoding â€” Converted categorical columns to numerical form using Label Encoding.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€”
5. Model Training â€”
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
6. Model Evaluation â€” Used Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix to compare performances.

Conclusion

Through these five tasks, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Each task allowed me to work with real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, explore patterns, and apply machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems.
This internship enhanced my skills in:
Data cleaning and handling missing values
Feature encoding and scaling
Data visualization for insights
Model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Overall, these projects strengthened my ability to apply data science techniques to solve practical business problems and present results clearly.
